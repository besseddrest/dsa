CHATGPT:

1. Dynamic Programming Challenges:
   Longest Increasing Subsequence: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
   Minimum Path Sum: Given a grid of numbers, find the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down.
   Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance): Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other (insert, delete, replace).
   Coin Change Problem: Given a set of coin denominations and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.
   House Robber Problem: Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money in each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police (no two adjacent houses can be robbed).
1. LRU Cache:
   Implement LRU Cache: This is a classic problem where you're asked to design a data structure that supports get and put operations, both with O(1) time complexity. This is often implemented using a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list.
