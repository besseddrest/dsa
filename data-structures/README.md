# Data Structures

-   General Notes from recent memory

## Linked List

**Plain English**

-   list of nodes where each node only contains a value and a reference to the next node
-   so, no jumping to an "index" (there are none). You have to walk through list and check each value

**Big O**

-   depends on the traversal
-   the actual operation of adding, deleting, is constant O(1) because you just change pointers

## Queue

### (Linked List)

**Plain English**

-   list of items
-   first-in, first-out
-   use dequeue() & enqueue()
-   peek() - returns val at head if exists

**Big O**

## Stack

### (Linked List)

**Plain English**

-   list of items
-   last-in, first-out
-   use pop() & push() methods

**Big O**
